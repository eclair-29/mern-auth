#### Quickstart Guide

Before doing this procedure, I assume that you clone this repository...

1. Run `npm install` to install dependecies for server side, then
2. Run `npm run client install` to install dependencies for the client side, then
3. Run  `npm run dev` to run the client & server with concurrently. and __Congratulations!!__ You run your own mern stack app.

> __Optional Scripts__: You can also run the following commands: `npm run server` (to run only the server side), and `npm run client` (to run only the client side).
